robot-simulator
===============

This is a project done as part of my Master Thesis (2005) and simulates distributed control algorithms for a collection of robots.  Over the coming months, I plan on updating this code and bringing it inline with the latest versions of Java since it was originally developed for Java 1.4 and possibly Java 5.

It is primarily open-sourced as a reference for me and to preserve it.
